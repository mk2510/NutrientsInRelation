NutrientsInRelation
===================

An App that helps you understand the cryptic description of your food.

The ingridients of many foods are printed on the package of them. But often nobody understands what they really mean. Can you picture how much 525 Calories is? No? But Nutrients in Relation is there to help you. The app tells you thats about the amount of calouries in five medium sized bananas and so helps you realize that you maybe shoudn't eat this lovely choclolate bar.
